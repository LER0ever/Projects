### About this server
This is my own [Gitea](https://gitea.io) instance running on a swarm/cluster of three Vultr servers, a desktop, and a laptop.  
You should be visiting this using [https://code.rongyi.io](https://code.rongyi.io) or [https://git.rongyi.io](https://git.rongyi.io), as they are the only two _official_ address of my git hosting.
