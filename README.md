### About this server
This is my own [Gitea](https://gitea.io) instance running on a swarm/cluster of three Vultr servers, a desktop, and a laptop.  
You should be visiting this using [https://code.rongyi.io](https://code.rongyi.io) or [https://git.rongyi.io](https://git.rongyi.io), as they are the only two _official_ address of my git hosting.

### My Projects
I have a lot more code than you think I do :)  
Therefore this serves as a "link hub" to direct you to my other projects.

_Currently I'm still busy migrating my projects one-by-one from Github/Gitlab to here. Below is an list of them that are already here._

#### [Server-Manifests](https://code.rongyi.io/LER0ever/Server-Manifests): Documentation and code to setup a swarm that powers my various web services including this one.

#### [AOSC.vim](https://code.rongyi.io/LER0ever/AOSC.vim): Vim plugin that makes whatever packaging life easier
